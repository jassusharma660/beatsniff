An online music service.    

---  

### Background    

I was always so fascinated by how websites were made. So, I started learning web development around 2010-2011. I was so struck by the process that it started becoming my passion, as I was only 13-14 years of age. I needed some projects to understand the technology thoroughly. So, I settled on making a digital music service called "Beatsniff". This project was created originally around 2012-2013. The project was meant to be a fully-fledged website but due to my exams going on at that time, I only managed to complete the front end and a tiny bit of PHP code that was going to work with the UI. It was a rigorous process as I was working day and night because of what I was achieving. Ideas were flying into my mind.
I uploaded this project here to show how far I came. Hope you'll like it.

>**_NOTE:_** I have not planned any future updates for this project as making new music service is much easier than maintaining a 7-year-old project.

>It is better to setup XAMPP or WAMP for this project and navigate to the folder with index.php file
